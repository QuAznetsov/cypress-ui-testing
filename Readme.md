## Cypress Tests Portfolio
This is presentation of my skills in Cypress
Here I have created several e2e tests for cypress-real-world-app
To run these tests you should clone cypress-real-world-app repository https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app and up it on you local machine with following commands

```yarn install```
```yarn db:seed:dev```
```yarn dev```

The application should be up and running on localhost:3000

After that you can run tests against cypress-real-world-app aplication from this repository
```yarn run cypress run```

Or open Cypress IDE and select any test and run it in UI mode 
```yarn run cypress open```
